## 🎯 Problem Statement

Senior citizens in India face significant barriers when adopting digital payment systems:

- **Fear of Scams**: Lack of awareness about phishing, fake payment requests, and fraudulent UPI links
- **Complexity**: UPI interfaces can be overwhelming for first-time users
- **Risk of Real Money Loss**: No safe environment to practice without financial consequences
- **Limited Digital Literacy**: Traditional banking customers struggle with smartphone-based payments
- **Lack of Motivation**: No structured learning path or incentives to practice regularly
